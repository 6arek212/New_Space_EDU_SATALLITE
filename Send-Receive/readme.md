## Description

Here is a code example for send and recevie packets using [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) radio communication. <br/>
The goal here is to create a communication between several parts of the system,  we will use LoRa to create a communication between the ground-end cubecell ans the satellite-end cubecell, then the satellite-end cubecell will triger the nanopai -> which will oparate the required oparation, return the data to the cubecell (the cubecellcubecell).
